RequirementsBazaar-WebFrontend
==============================

This project is a web interface to the requirements bazaar service. The project aims to offer user and developers a platform on which to cooperate. To read more about the idea behind requirements bazaar read the service page. This Web interface is built as a single page application using AngularJS 1.3 and Polymer 1.0.


Develop
----------
To start developing on the project. Make sure you have a running requirements bazaar service, which comes with demo data, otherwise you wonâ€™t be able to see much. Then check out this project and then run following commands.

Make sure node.js and git are installed
```
node --version && npm --version && git --version
```
Install bower and grunt
```
npm install --global bower grunt-cli
```
Navigate to project folder and install dependencies and bower components with
```
npm install
bower install
```

Start in browser
```
grunt serve
```

Usage / Deployment
----------
If you are not interested in developing the project, then you can just build the project, then follow the steps in develop section until ```grunt serve```. Now open the bazaarServiceConfig.js file in app/scripts/config and fill in the bazaar service location and the oauth endpoint. After changing this run ```grunt build```. This creates a dist folder where you can find the minimized project, that can be deployed on any web server. Important, the build currently does not include the bower components, so you need to copy this into the dist.
