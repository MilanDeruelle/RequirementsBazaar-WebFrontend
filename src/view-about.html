      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Requirements Bazaar is a Web-based tool for continuous innovation through stakeholder participation. On this
        page, we introduce our team and explain the background of the methodology, the research work behind and finally
        suggest some ways how to contribute.</p>

      <h2>Presentations</h2>

      <p>Here, we list some of the presentations we gave about the Requirements Bazaar at various outlets.</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <p>Here is a non-comprehensive list of research literature that is either about the Requirements Bazaar, or citing
        such work and putting it in the context of related work.</p>

      <h2>Technical Background</h2>

      <p>Requirements Bazaar consists of a Java-based backend and an HTML5 frontend. The backend is driven by the
        peer-to-peer platform <a href="https://las2peer.org" target="_blank">las2peer</a> which is part of our research.
        The frontend is developed using HTML5 Web Components with the help of the Polymer library.</p>


      <h2>How to Contribute</h2>

      <p>If you are convinced about Requirements Bazaar and want to participate, you are more than welcome! Either
        by pull requests to one of our open source repositories, by sending us design proposals, or by volunteering
        to translate the page to one of your native languages.</p>
